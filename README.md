DexterJB-Kernel-TAR
===================

Some of you may have noticed that after you have repo sync'd and attempted to build you have gotten errors from the kernel
that it is missing certain files. I am trying to fix that in the github, however I have created this so you can simply 
download the TAR of the kernel and extract it yourself to fix any issues.

Just make sure you extract it to this your kernel/htc/flyer directory

This should take care of any kernel issues you may have. I will be updating the github to fix the issues shortly as well
as putting a prebuilt kernel image in the device folder that will help with the Flyer build.

This kernel is Credited to Dexter and Chaosz until I get my own kernel up and running.
